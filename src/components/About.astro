          Hi, I’m Samantha, a seamstress and maker based in Bozeman, Montana.
          I’ve been creating since I was a little girl, learning how to make doll
          clothes with my great grandmother. I received formal training from the
          University of Delaware, studying Apparel Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since moving to Bozeman five years ago, I have combined my love
          for thrifting and sewing by upcycling vintage textiles into one of
          a kind pieces. After 5 years in the apparel industry coordinating production in factories
          overseas, I am ready to work with my hands again.
        </p>
